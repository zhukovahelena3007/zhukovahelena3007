## Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently looking for a job as a Data Scientist.
I decided to change my career from clinical trials to IT. My motivation was a more flexible schedule and remote work, an interest in modern technology,
machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and the opportunity for professional growth and development in a dynamically developing field.
- 🛠️ Skills: Python, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Machine Learning, CatBoost, Seaborn, Scipy
- 📫 How to reach me: Telegram @zhu_zhu07
- ⚡ Fact: love horses 🏇
